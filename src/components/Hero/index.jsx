       Lets dive into my childhood, I&apos;ve broken more things
        as a child than I can count. from game-boy&apos;s to my mother&apos;s computer.
        My curiosity drove me to discover and learn how
        things work. from all my small mistakes I&apos;ve learned one thing. that the
        most important thing in life is curiosity and its ability to massively
        improve results. being able to pick up technology or a tool and swiftly
        grasp its in and outs to be able to materialize my idea into a
        functional product is what I&apos;m mostly fond of.
